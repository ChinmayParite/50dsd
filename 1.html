                <h2><strong>What are Logic Families</strong> </h2>
        
                <p>
                    Logic families are groups of logic circuits that are based on particular types of elements (resistors, transistors, and so forth).
                    Families are identified by the manner in which the elements are connected, and, in some cases, by the types of elements used.
                </p>
    
                <h3><strong>CMOS v/s TTL</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    There are two different types of computer chips: CMOS and TTL. CMOS stands for complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor. TTL stands for transistor-transistor logic. They’re both oftentimes used to make microchips. However, they’re both different and serve different functions. To learn more about the difference between CMOS and TTL, we must understand its functioning.

                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The difference between CMOS and TTL is that CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) is an electronic component in the logic family. CMOS is used in computers and various other electronic devices. TTL (transistor-transistor logic) is a type of digital logic in the logic family. TTL is also used in computers and various other electronic devices.

                </p>

                <p>
                    CMOS, Or complementary metal oxide semiconductor, uses PMOS and NMOS types of field-effect transistors to handle input and output. They are commonly used in NAND and NOR gates and are economically efficient, and have a higher clock rate making them consume more power than TTL or transistor-transistor logic units.

                </p>

                <p>
                    
                    TTL and Transistor-Transistor Logic Units are made up of BJTs Or bipolar junction transistors that commonly have multiple inputs and outputs. They have a slightly lower density of logic gates and usually are found with NAND gates. However, they consume less power and hence are used in several devices.

                    <strong>AND Gate</strong>
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The AND gate is a digital logic gate with ‘n’ i/ps one o/p, which performs logical conjunction based on the combinations of its inputs. The output of this gate is true only when all the inputs are true. When one or more inputs of the AND gate’s i/ps are false, then only the output of the AND gate is false. The symbol and truth table of an AND gate with two inputs is shown below.

                    The NOT gate is a digital logic gate with one input and one output that operates an inverter operation of the input. The output of the NOT gate is the reverse of the input. When the input of the NOT gate is true then the output will be false and vice versa. The symbol and truth table of a NOT gate with one input is shown below. By using this gate, we can implement NOR and NAND gates
